# Automatic Quality Assurance reports for the metadata of the 'master' branch

This branch contains automatically generated QA reports after each commit/merge of SAML metadata into the 'master' branch.
The tracked file from which the reports are generated is: https://github.com/clarin-eric/SPF-SPs-metadata/blob/master/clarin-sp-metadata.xml

Typically the reports are available in less than 5 minutes after the commit/merge, but check for the last commit to this branch to see if you have an updated report.
