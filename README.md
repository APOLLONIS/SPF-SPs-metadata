# Automatic Quality Assurance reports for the metadata of the 'master' branch

This branch contains automatically generated QA reports after each commit/merge of SAML metadata into the *master* branch.
The reports are generated in respect to the [clarin-sp-metadata.xml](https://github.com/clarin-eric/SPF-SPs-metadata/blob/master/clarin-sp-metadata.xml) file of the *master* branch.

You can visualize the most recent report rendered [here](https://clarin-eric.github.io/SPF-SPs-metadata/page/master_qa_report.html).

New reports will be available as soon as the travis CI build succeeds, after the pull request has been merged into the *master* branch. Check for the latest commit to this branch to see if you have an updated report.
